## Description

**Email Blocklist** helps you keep your WordPress site safe and clean by preventing registrations and comments from users with disposable, temporary, or otherwise unwanted email domains.

Spam registrations and fake accounts often rely on throwaway email addresses. With Email Blocklist, you can easily stop them at the source. The plugin lets you build and manage your own custom blocklist of domains to prevent low-quality signups, spam comments, and fake interactions.

Unlike many similar plugins, **Email Blocklist is completely free and does not rely on any paid APIs or third-party services**. Everything runs directly on your WordPress installation. No hidden costs, no subscriptions – just a lightweight solution that does one job and does it well.
